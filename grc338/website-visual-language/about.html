                        Eichenseer-House Woodfired Pizza was born in 2025 from a simple idea: great pizza starts with great people and a welcoming place to gather. Nestled in the heart of San Luis Obispo, our pizzeria was built to feel more like a home than a storefront, where the warmth of a crackling wood-fired oven and the scent of fresh dough set the tone the moment you step through the door. Inspired by old-world techniques and California’s love for fresh, local ingredients, every pizza we make tells a story of craft, care, and community.

                        Our dough is made fresh daily, slowly fermented to develop rich flavor and a perfectly airy, chewy bite. Each pizza is hand-stretched, topped with thoughtfully sourced ingredients, and fired in our traditional wood oven until the crust blisters to perfection. From classic favorites to seasonal creations inspired by Central Coast produce, our menu is designed to honor tradition while embracing creativity. At Eichenseer-House, pizza is more than a meal — it’s an experience.
